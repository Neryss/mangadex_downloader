# mangadex_downloader

## Usage

It's a program used to download a manga localy on your computer.
Since it's using mangadex' api, it might take a while to download it because it needs to wait 30 seconds between each volume for now to dodge rate limiting.
I might find a better solution in the future though.

You can execute it, it will ask for an url, you can grab it on the homepage of a manga on [mangadex](https://mangadex.org/).

I still have several things to add to this project such as more error handling, better settings, maybe an UI if I have the will to do so, and some other things I'll add
to a to do list soon tm.

You can report any bugs you found on the github page.
